<br><i><h1>What are Mountain Bicycles?</h1></i>
<br><b>A mountain bike (MTB) or mountain bicycle is a bicycle designed for
off-road cycling. Mountain bikes share some similarities with other
bicycles, but incorporate. A mountain bike usually has wide knobby
tires that offer more substantial grip and traction on a variety of
surfaces, including gravel, dirt, rock and sand. Tire pressure on mountain
bikes is less than on road bikes, due to their greater volume and the better
traction offered by a softer tire.</b>
