<br><i><h1><font color=blue>What are Electric Bicycles?</h1></i></font>
<br><b><font color=blue>Even for e-bikes that have a throttle, you'll need to pedal 
when going up long, steep hills, although you won't have to pedal 
hard. Pedaling is more fun, extends the range of your battery, extends
the life of your motor, and extends your own life too.E-bikes use rechargeable
batteries that can travel up to 25 to 45 km/h, much faster than most
people would cycle, getting you to your destination quicker and in 
better shape. In a nutshell they offer low cost, energy efficient, 
and emission-free transportation which also has physical and health
benefits.</b>
