<br><i><h1>What are Gear Bicycles?</h1></i>
<br><b>Most geared bikes have one, two, or three chainrings in the front
(the rings attached to the pedal crank arm) and anywhere from seven
to 12 gears—or cogs—in the back (or the cassette attached to the rear wheel).
Moving the chain from the smallest rear cog to the largest eases your
pedaling effort incrementally.A gear is a wheel with teeth, sometimes known as a cog, whose job is
to transmit power from one machine's part to another in order to accelerate 
or decelerate speed, increase force or change the direction of a machine.
... Since teeth fit together, when on wheel turns, the other turns
too. Increase speed: If you connect two gears together and the first
one has more teeth than the second one (generally that means it's a
bigger-sized wheel), the second one has to turn round much faster to
keep up. So this arrangement means the second wheel turns faster than 
the first one but with less force.</b>
