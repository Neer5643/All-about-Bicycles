<br><i><h1><font color=blue>What are Downhill Bicycles?</h1></i></font>
<br><b><font color=blue>Downhill bikes are designed for steep, gnarly terrain, speed, big
drops, and jumps. With these bikes, you're usually looking for some
other way to the top of the trail whether that's hiking, shuttling
or a chairlift. They simply aren't made to go any direction but down.
Downhill bikes are designed for going incredibly fast down hills, so
for just about anything else, be it climbing, singletrack, or just pedalling
about with your mates, they're not so great.</b></font>
