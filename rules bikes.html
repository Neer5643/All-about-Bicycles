<br><i><h1>What are the Rules of riding a Bicycle?</h1></i>
<br><b>Protect yourself: Invest in a good helmet. Make yourself visible. Maintain
a safe distance from vehicles. Look out for obstacles and road hazards.
Maintain your bike well. Make sure you follow all traffic rules. Remember
that your bike will not stop as soon as you press the brakes. Slow down
and stop at every junction.</b>
