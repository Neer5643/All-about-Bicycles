<br><i><h1>What are BMX Bicycles?</h1></i>
<br><b>They were knockoffs of motocross motorcycles and were designed for 
racing over jumps and around berms in the dirt. ... BMX bikes are still 
designed for racing, although your child doesn't have to race to enjoy 
the light weight, speed and dirt-worthiness of these machines. BMX 
bikes are still designed for racing, although you don't have to race
to enjoy their nimble and precise handling. They have 20-inch wheels, 
2- or 4-piece handlebars, small seats, long cranks and strong rear hand 
brakes. The frames are light and sturdy, and the higher the price, the 
lighter they get.</b>
